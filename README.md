### Breakdown of Solution

Finding the longest zigzag path in a binary tree. A zigzag path alternates between left and right child nodes as we traverse the tree.

### **Approach**

1. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Used a helper function to traverse the binary tree recursively.
   - At each node, tracked:
     - The direction we came from (left or right).
     - The current length of the zigzag path.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - If the previous direction was **left**, the next step in the zigzag must go **right** (and vice versa).
   - If the direction alternates, we increment the zigzag path length.
   - If the direction doesn't alternate, we reset the zigzag path length to `0`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `null`, stop the traversal.

4. **Tracking the Longest Path**:
   - Updated a global variable `maxZigzag` to store the longest zigzag path length encountered during the traversal.

5. **Starting Point**:
   - At the root node, we considered both possible directions (left and right) and begin the traversal.

### **Why This Works**
- The recursive function ensures that every possible zigzag path is explored.
- The `maxZigzag` variable tracks the longest zigzag path efficiently across all recursive calls.

### **Efficiency**
- Time Complexity: **O(N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node once.
- Space Complexity: **O(H)**, where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.


### **Result**
Identified the longest zigzag path as `2`.
